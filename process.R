                  "Transvaginal ultrasounds are done ALOT. Especially if doing intrauterine inseminations or injectable hormone treatments. Because of this, infertility patients can visually confirm as early as 4-5 weeks that they are pregnant.",
                  "Your blood is drawn ALOT during infertility treatments to measure hormone levels and confirm pregnancy. The amount of blood draws increase if a patient is taking hormonal injections and if pregnancy needs to be confirmed. I've personally experienced something informally called 'Beta Hell' where beta pregnancy hormone levels are continually measured via blood draw every two days after a positive home pregnany test is recieved. If your beta levels are not high enough or not doubling fast enough a miscarriage may be imminent."))

This can create anxiety and stress for individuals that are actively trying to get pregnant and haven't within one year. So much is unknown to the general public about how complicated the scientific process of pregnancy is. Most that go through infertility treatment are thrown into a world of exhaustion, anxiety, stress, and bewilderment.\n\nNo fertility journey&nbsp;is identical. The process can take as little as a few months, or as long as multiple years. The longer an individual is in infertility treatment, the more susceptible they are to developing anxiety, depression, and other mental difficulties.\n\nBecause this topic is so taboo and data is still lacking in the field, I've decided to create my own. After 3 years of actively trying to conceive, mental breakdowns, sleepless nights, and constant medical visits, this is the result of my personal fertility journey...")+
